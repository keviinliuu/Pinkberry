This is a (pretty cool) theme that I made for myself. However, please feel free to download and try it out yourself!

# How to Install

1. Download the .vsix file located in this repository
2. Hit Ctrl+Shift+P and search "Extensions: Install from VSIX"
3. Find the vsix file (wherever you downloaded it) and upload it
4. Reload your VSCode

Hope you enjoy! :D
